# F.A.D.E.-TCG
F.A.D.E. (Fighter's Arena, Destructive Encounters) is a Trading Card Game based on the concepts found in fighters, beat-em-ups, and shounen anime/manga, as well as my own personal spin on the TCG/CCG genre. It's still a work-in-progress.

Everything you see here can be used to play the game via Tabletop Simulator or LackeyCCG, and you can even make your own cards with the Templates I've provided. I'll be keeping this page up-to-date with my own personal sets of cards for everyone to enjoy playing the game.

The templates, name of the game, and imagery/illustration work used were mostly self-designed, barring some exceptions in the form of commission work and/or code examples. You may not print these out yourself, sell them, or distribute them outside of using this Github page. If you make your own cards, you're free to distribute them and play with them, but you cannot sell them for any form of profit.
