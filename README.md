# F.A.D.E.-TCG
F.A.D.E. (Fighter's Arena, Destructive Encounters) is a Trading Card Game based on some concepts found in fighters, beat-em-ups, and shounen anime/manga, as well as my own personal spin on the TCG/CCG genre. It's still a work-in-progress.

The templates are useable with Magic Set Editor 2.1.2 which can be found here: https://github.com/twanvl/MagicSetEditor2

The templates, name of the game, and imagery/illustration work used were mostly self-designed, barring some exceptions in the form of commission work and/or code examples. If you make your own cards, you must not sell them and you must cite your source materials. Otherwise, feel free to distribute them however you wish.
