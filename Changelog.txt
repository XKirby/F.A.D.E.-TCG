  - It now has 89 cards. It's still WIP.

<< Posted on January 19, 2020 >>

  - This allows multiple Supertypes to be on the same card!
  - Synchronize now works differently due to these changes.
Updated the LackeyCCG Plugin.
  - It's gonna take a while to update the Tabletop Simulator table. I might also get rid of the Shadered cards, not sure yet.

  - It was missing set WLH (whoops).

<< Posted on June 17, 2019 >>
Added Set WLH - World of Lost Heroes back in!
  - This completes Generation 1, but obviously there's plenty of room for improvement!
  - This set was also majorly reworked, most of the cards were cut out due to just being weirdly designed or inherently bad.

<< Posted on June 3, 2019 >>
Minor Card Balancing and Fixing.
  - Mostly a lot of typo fixing and rewording. I did rebalance some stuff to make more sense though.
  - There's a bit more I have to do here, but it should all at least make sense now.
Added a couple of line art illustrations.
Added a couple of untested "theme" decks to the LackeyCCG Plugin.
  - They follow a single element archtype, or at least try to.

<< Posted on May 17, 2019 >>
Added a new keyword, and boy is it a big one for such a generic effect.
  - Catalyst
Updated the MSE Template so that Deck Text Exports from Lackey work with TTS.
  - This should be relatively painless now and also makes my deck builder, as well as the Decker build, obsolete.
Updated the LackeyCCG Plugin to reflect the MSE Template changes.
